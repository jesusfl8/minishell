This project involves the design and implementation of a command interpreter (shell) in the C programming language, running on a Unix-based operating system. The interpreter will allow users to input commands, which the program will parse and execute, providing an interface to interact with the Unix system. This project was developed as part of the Operating Systems course at the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid
